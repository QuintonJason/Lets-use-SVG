#Let's use SVG

The web is growing. Sites are growing and images play a major role in this problem. This affects us all because longer load times provide a bad user experience. SVG solves this problem while containing many features to enhance the user's experience: accessibility, resolution independence, and interactivity.

These features coupled with the ability to use SVG as a font system make this element one that will greatly help in moving the web forward.

In this talk Quinton Jason will show us why we should use SVG, how to style SVG with CSS, and why we should use SVG as a font system.
